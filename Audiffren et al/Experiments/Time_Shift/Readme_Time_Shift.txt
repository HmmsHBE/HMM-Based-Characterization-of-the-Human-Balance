This folder contains the results of different executions of the method proposed in [1] with various time-shifts(1, 5 and 10) 
It contains the subdirectories "Shift_$KAPPA$", with KAPPA = 1, 5 and 10. Each subdirectory has the following items:
   1- The subdirectory "Organized_Processed" which contains the dataset proposed in [2] in an organized format 
     alongside with the corresponding experimental results.
   2- The file "NonFaller_Vectors.txt" containing the final vectors of the non fallers in the dataset proposed in [2] after the method described in [1] 
     has been applied on it with the corresponding time-shift. These vectors are obtained using the program "Audiffren et al/Stabilo.c" that
	 produces the file "SubjectVectors.txt", which must be later renamed as "NonFaller_Vectors.txt" in the folder "Audiffren et al".
   3- The file "Faller_Vectors.txt" containing the final vectors of the fallers in the dataset proposed in [2] after the method described in [1]  
     has been applied on it with the corresponding time-shift. These vectors are obtained using the program "Audiffren et al/Stabilo.c"  that
	 produces the file "SubjectVectors.txt", which must be later renamed as "Faller_Vectors.txt" in the folder "Audiffren et al".
 
The program "Audiffren et al/Stabilo.c" is compiled and executed as follow:
________________________________________________________________________________________________   
   Compilation command line:

   gcc -Wall -Wl,--stack,536870912 -o Stabilo.exe Stabilo.c
________________________________________________________________________________________________   
   Execution command line:

   Stabilo.exe DirectoryName FreqDiv TimeShift NbSamples MaxIterations Threshold SaveHMMs
   
    1- 'DirectoryName' is the name of a folder containing the input dataset in the organized format. 
	  The subdirectories "Audiffren et al/The_Dataset/Organized/Faller" and "Audiffren et al/The_Dataset/Organized/NonFaller" 
	  were used in [1] for this purpose.  You must paste a copy these subdirectories in the folder "Audiffren et al" before running the program.
    2- 'FreqDiv' is the parameter SIGMA of down-sampling step explained in Section 4.2 of [1].
    3- 'TimeShift' is the desired time-shift.
    4- 'NbSamples' is the number N used in the Equation 3 of [1] to split the interval [0, 100].
    5- 'MaxIterations' is the maximum number of iterations for the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    6- 'Threshold' is the threshold belonging to [0, 100] and corresponding to the learning rate of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    7- 'SaveHMMs' is a binary parameter such that (SaveHMMs=0) if we do not want to record the resulting HMMs in a textfile, 
	  otherwise (SaveHMMs=1).

   Example of execution: 
   
   Stabilo.exe Faller 1 1 10 100 100.0 1
   Stabilo.exe NonFaller 1 1 10 100 100.0 1

The execution of the previous program produces several files and directories:
1- It produces under each test condition of each subject (e.g: "Faller/1/Closed") of the input directory, a subdirectory named "Results".
   a- The subdirectory "Results" contains the files : "MCs.txt", "AllVectors.txt" and "MeanVector.txt".
   b- "MCs.txt" contains the Markov chains produced by the method proposed in [1] (Section 4.2.1).
      These Markov chains are represented as ORDERED sequences of pairs (e,s) such that each pair (e,s) 
      materializes the fact that the symbol (s) is observed from the state (e). These Markov chains are generated 
      following the method explained at the Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of [1]. Two consecutive pairs (e,s)(x,y) mean that 
	  there is a state transition from the state e to the state x.
   c- "AllVectors.txt" contains the vectors derived from the HMMs as explained in the Section 4.2.4 of [1]. 
       A vector is derived for each file representing a statokinesigram.
   d- "MeanVector.txt" contains the mean vector of the vectors in "AllVectors.txt" as explained in the Section 4.2.5 and the Equation 10 of [1].
2- A file named "SubjectVectors.txt" containing the final vectors generated by the method proposed in [1].
   This file must later be renamed "Faller_Vectors.txt" or "NonFaller_Vectors.txt" (depending on the input directory)  
   as those saved in the subdirectory "Audiffren et al/Experiments/Time_Shift/Shift_$KAPPA$", with KAPPA = 1, 5 and 10.
   The first item of each line in the file "SubjectVectors.txt" represents the id of the subject into squared brackets.
3- If the parameter 'SaveHMMs' is 1, it produces a subdirectory containing the initial and final HMMs.
