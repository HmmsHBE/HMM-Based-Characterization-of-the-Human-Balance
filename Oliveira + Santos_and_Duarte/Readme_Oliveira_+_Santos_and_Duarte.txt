The current folder contains the following items:
    1- The subdirectory "The_Parkinson_Dataset" containing the dataset proposed in [2] and used in [1].
    2- The subdirectory "Experiments" containing the experimental results presented in the Section 6.3 of [1].
    3- The C codes (two '.c' files and two '.h' files) used during the experiments performed in [1].
	  Instructions for compiling and executing these codes are available in help files located in 
	  the directories "Oliveira + Santos_and_Duarte/Experiments/Arffs" and "Oliveira + Santos_and_Duarte/Experiments/Time_Shift".
