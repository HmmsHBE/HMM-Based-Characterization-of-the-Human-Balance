This folder contains:
    1- The directory "Original" which contains the dataset proposed in [1] in the original format.
       Each statokinesigram is saved in '.txt' file named "PDPDS$X$$MEDICATION$$SURFACE$$EYES$$TRIAL$.txt" where: 
          a- 'X' is the Id of the subject in his group.
	      b- 'MEDICATION' is either 'on' or 'off'. 
		  c- 'SURFACE' is either 'rs' (firm) or 'us' (foam).
		  d- 'EYES' is either 'ec' (eyes closed) or 'eo' (eyes open).
		  e- 'TRIAL' is the trial number varying between 1 and 6.
	   Each statokinesigram contains the following information:
          a- 'Time[s]': the recording time.
          b- 'GRFap[N]', 'GRFml[N]' and 'GRFv[N]': The forces applied by the subject on the force platform.
		  c- 'Map[N.m]', 'Mml[N.m]', 'Mv[N.m]' and 'Mfree[N.m]': The moments of these forces.
          d- 'COPap[cm]' and 'COPml[cm]': The current coordinates of the Center Of Pressure of the subject.
    2- The directory "Organized" which contains the dataset proposed in [1] in an organized format.
	   The original data are grouped by subject Id, surface and test condition. 
       For example, the subdirectory "Organized/1/Firm/Closed/" contains all the statokinesigrams recorded for the subject number 1 
	   on a firm surface, in the test condition "Eyes Closed". Similarly, , the subdirectory "Organized/Foam/1/Open/" contains 
	   all the statokinesigrams recorded for the subject number 1, on a foam surface, in the test condition "Eyes Open".
    3- The file 'PDPDSinfo.txt' containing detailed information related to each statokinesigram.
