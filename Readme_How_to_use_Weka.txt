Run WEKA to perform classification experiments as those of the Section 6.3 in [1].
The '.arff' files taken as input by WEKA and used in [1] are saved in the following subdirectories 
of the current folder:
   1- "Oliveira + Santos_and_Duarte/Experiments/Arffs/"
   2- "Santos_and_Duarte/Experiments/Arffs/Age10/"
   3- "Santos_and_Duarte/Experiments/Arffs/BEST10/"
